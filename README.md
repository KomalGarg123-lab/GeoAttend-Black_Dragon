# GeoAttend-Black_Dragon
A smart, automated, and secure attendance system that eliminates manual check-ins and time fraud. It ensures accurate work hours with GPS auto check-in, facial recognition (auto check-out after 5 mins mismatch), and manual check-in for offsite work. Data is encrypted, consent-based, and stored in JSON, ensuring privacy and accuracy.
Sure! I can help you create a README file for your GitHub repository that explains your Employee Attendance System project. This README will provide an overview of the project, instructions for setup and usage, and any other relevant information.
